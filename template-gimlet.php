    <p class="CaseStudyTextBlock">Gimlet Media was born from the popular podcast StartUp, hosted by former This American Life and Planet Money producer, Alex Blumberg. His goal was to start a new podcast network company that would seize on the opportunity presented by the rise in popularity of podcasts. As they began to mature it was clear they needed a team to provide clear leadership on their website and digital presence.</p>

    <h2 class="CaseStudyHeaderGimlet">Concept Driven Design &amp; Development</h2>
    <p class="container">Our first order of business with Gimlet’s website was to provide a conceptual direction for the website based on the company’s brand. Without a lot of source material to start with, we began to create a visual system that would serve as a general guideline and was helpful in building consensus with the client’s team.</p>

    <h2 class="CaseStudyHeaderGimlet">A Place for Everything</h2>
    <p class="container lrg-padding-bottom">We believe that good information design is critical to user experience on the web so we dedicated time to refining how the site’s content was put together and what the best navigation system was.</p>

    <p class="container">With branding guidelines in place and a new architecture, we then set about designing the interface for both the desktop and mobile views of the site. The goal was to create a simple presentation of information that didn’t require the client investing in a lot of new visual content to be created from scratch.</p>

    <h2 class="CaseStudyHeaderGimlet blue-text">The Art of Managing Content</h2>
    <p class="CaseStudyTextBlock container">While we iterated on typography, colors, and other visual aspects we began the work of setting up the back-end for the site in Wordpress and migrating content from the first version of the site. This involved writing a lot of custom API connects with services like MailChimp and SoundCloud as well as customization of the WordPress administrative experience so that it was easily for producers to maintain and update.</p>

    <h2 class="CaseStudyHeaderGimlet">Social. Sharable. Memorable.</h2>
    <p class="container lrg-padding-bottom">Social media is one of the key factors in attracting new listeners for Gimlet, but the standard content feeds most users see when logging in to Twitter or Facebook are filled with posts from a huge variety of sources. Being able to stand out is difficult and important. By building a custom plugin to create images from episode quotes helps the tweets and posts stand out and makes for more compelling, sharable content.</p>

<p class="CaseStudyTextBlock container">One of these releases included the launch of Gimlet’s membership program.
